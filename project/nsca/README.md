# NSCA: Nexus Smart Contract Analyzer
NSCA is a cutting-edge smart contract analysis and optimization tool built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze and optimize smart contracts, ensuring they are secure, efficient, and reliable.

# Features
- Smart Contract Analysis: NSCA's advanced analyzer class provides in-depth analysis of smart contracts, identifying potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and complexity.
- Smart Contract Optimization: NSCA's optimizer class optimizes smart contracts, reducing gas consumption and execution time, while maintaining their original functionality.
- Neural Network Model: NSCA's neural network model is trained on a large dataset of smart contracts, enabling it to learn patterns and relationships between code structures and potential issues.
- Pre-Trained Models: NSCA comes with pre-trained models for the neural network, allowing for quick and accurate analysis and optimization of smart contracts.
- Unit Tests: NSCA includes comprehensive unit tests for the analyzer and optimizer classes, ensuring the tool's reliability and accuracy.
