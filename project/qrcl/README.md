# Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Library (QRCL)
The Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Library (QRCL) is a comprehensive library of cryptographic algorithms and protocols designed to provide long-term security against quantum attacks. QRCL is specifically tailored to enhance the security of the NexusChain platform, protecting transactions and data from potential quantum threats.

# Motivation
The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to classical cryptography, as quantum computers can potentially break certain classical encryption algorithms. To ensure the integrity of the NexusChain platform, we must adopt quantum-resistant cryptography to safeguard against these potential attacks.

# Features
- Quantum-Resistant Algorithms: QRCL includes a suite of quantum-resistant algorithms, such as:
- Lattice-based cryptography (e.g., NTRU, Ring-LWE)
- Code-based cryptography (e.g., McEliece)
- Multivariate cryptography (e.g., Rainbow)
- Hash-based signatures (e.g., SPHINCS)
- Key Agreement Protocols: QRCL provides implementations of quantum-resistant key agreement protocols, such as:
- New Hope
- FrodoKEM
- SIDH
- Digital Signatures: QRCL includes quantum-resistant digital signature schemes, such as:
- Dilithium
- Falcon
- Hybrid Cryptography: QRCL supports hybrid cryptography, allowing for the combination of classical and quantum-resistant algorithms to provide a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography.

# Implementation
QRCL is implemented in Python, with a focus on performance, security, and ease of use. The library is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration with existing systems and frameworks.

# Security
QRCL is designed with security in mind, following best practices for cryptographic library development. The library includes:

- Secure Random Number Generation: QRCL uses a secure random number generator to ensure the integrity of cryptographic keys and nonces.
- Side-Channel Attack Mitigations: QRCL includes mitigations against side-channel attacks, such as constant-time implementations and data-oblivious algorithms.
- Formal Verification: QRCL's algorithms and protocols are formally verified to ensure their correctness and security.

# Getting Started
